SecureZone - A movie inspired screen lock/saver written in C and SDL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
SecureZone locks your X session, and has a movie inspired and high tech
look. The purpose of creating this application, was just me who wanted
to learn a bit about SDL, and ofc, for the fun of it ;)

2. Prerequisites
You will need the essential build tools (gcc, make, etc.), and
libsdl + libsdl_image

3. Installation
Edit the config.mk to suit your desired setup.
Run "make" to build securezone and then run "make install" to install
it to your system (NOTE! You may need to be root for this).
