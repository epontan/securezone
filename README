SecureZone - A movie inspired screen locker written in C, using Xlib and PAM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
SecureZone locks your X session, and has a movie inspired and high tech
look. The purpose of creating this application, was just me who wanted
to learn a bit about Xlib and PAM, as well as the fun of doing it ;)

2. Prerequisites
You will need the essential build tools (gcc, make, etc.), and
libx11 + (libxinerama + libext) + libpam

3. Installation
Edit the config.mk to suit your desired setup.
Run "make" to build securezone and then run "make install" to install
it to your system (NOTE! You may need to be root for this).
